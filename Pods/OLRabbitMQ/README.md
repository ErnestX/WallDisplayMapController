### OLRabbitMQ

Objective-C wrapper for rabbitmq-c.

### Installation

* Xcode Subproject
* Cocoapods

#### Requirements

* dependency on Pod 'rabbitmqc' - rabbitmq-c.
* if you do not use cocopads you need add rabbitmq-c (currently version 0.6.1 for all architectures armv7, arm64, x86_64 and i386)

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "OLRabbitMQ", "~> 0.0.2"
```

### Usage

#### Create socket AMQP
```objective-c
OLRabbitMQSocket _socketAMQP = [[OLRabbitMQSocket alloc] initWithIp:<address ip> port:<port>];
[_socketAMQP createSocketWithVhost:<vhost> login:<login> password:<password> callback:^(BOOL ready, NSError *error) {
	// your implementation...
}];
```

#### Bind to Exchange
```objective-c
OLRabbitMQExchange *exchange = [[OLRabbitMQExchange alloc] initWithSocket:<OLRabbitMQSocket instance>];
[exchange bindExchange:<exchange string name> routingKey:<exchange routing key string>];
```

#### Unbind to Exchange
```objective-c
OLRabbitMQExchange *exchange = [[OLRabbitMQExchange alloc] initWithSocket:<OLRabbitMQSocket instance>];
[exchange unbindExchange:<exchange string name> routingKey:<exchange routing key string>];
```

#### Consume
```objective-c
[exchange basicConsume];
```

#### Response Operation Queue
``` objective-c
OLRabbitMQOperation *operation = [[OLRabbitMQOperation alloc] initWithSocket:<OLRabbitMQSocket instance>];
operation.delegate = self;
[[NSOperationQueue new] addOperation:operation];
```

#### Delegate Operation Queue
```objective-c
- (void)amqpResponse:(NSData *)data routingKey:(NSString *)routingKey;
```
