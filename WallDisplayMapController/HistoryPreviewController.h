 How the cache works: 
 
 An NSMutableArray named imagesCache, which stores an UIImage at each entry;
 The size of the array is not fixed;
 The index of the array is the index of the save entry;
 Each entry of the array could be NSNull, indicating that the entry is not in the cahce;
 When the cache is too large for the memory, it will be cleared;
 When an entry is cleared, it is set to NSNull instead of being removed from the array.
